# N8N Voice AI Workflows - Manager Presentation

## Executive Summary

Our Voice AI system leverages N8N (Node-based workflow automation) to create a comprehensive, professional automation platform that handles voice interactions, data processing, and follow-up communications.

## Core N8N Workflows Overview

### 1. **Voice Webhook Trigger Workflow**
**Purpose**: Primary entry point for all voice AI interactions

**Components**:
- **Voice Webhook** (`/voice-trigger`)
  - Receives real-time call events from VAPI
  - Handles: `call_started`, `call_ended`, `transcript`, `function_call`
  - Processes user interactions in real-time

**Data Flow**:
```
VAPI Voice Call → Voice Webhook → Event Filtering → Data Processing
```

### 2. **Customer Service Workflow**
**Purpose**: Specialized handling for customer service interactions

**Components**:
- **Customer Service Webhook** (`/customer-service`)
  - Dedicated endpoint for customer service calls
  - Enhanced sentiment analysis
  - Priority routing for urgent issues

**Features**:
- Real-time sentiment detection
- Escalation triggers for negative sentiment
- Customer preference tracking

### 3. **Email Callback Workflow**
**Purpose**: Professional follow-up communication system

**Components**:
- **Email Callback Webhook** (`/email-callback`)
  - Handles post-call communications
  - Professional email template system
  - Timezone-aware scheduling

## Detailed Workflow Breakdown

### **Event Processing Pipeline**

#### **Call Started Event**
```
Voice Webhook → Call Started Filter → Extract Call Data → Get User Memory
```

**What happens**:
1. **Voice Webhook** receives `call_started` event
2. **Call Started Filter** validates event type
3. **Extract Call Data** captures:
   - User ID and call ID
   - Phone number
   - Timezone information
   - Timestamp
4. **Get User Memory** retrieves conversation history

#### **Transcript Processing**
```
Customer Service Webhook → Transcript Filter → Extract Transcript Data → RAG Query
```

**What happens**:
1. **Transcript Filter** processes real-time speech
2. **Extract Transcript Data** captures:
   - Speech transcript
   - Confidence scores
   - Speaker identification
   - Sentiment analysis
3. **RAG Query** searches knowledge base for relevant responses

#### **Call Ended Processing**
```
Email Callback Webhook → Call Ended Filter → Create Call Summary → CRM Integration
```

**What happens**:
1. **Call Ended Filter** detects call completion
2. **Create Call Summary** generates:
   - Call duration and outcome
   - Sentiment analysis results
   - Key conversation points
3. **CRM Integration** creates contact records

## Professional Features

### **1. Memory System Integration**
- **Get User Memory**: Retrieves conversation history from Redis
- **Update Memory**: Stores new interactions with timestamps
- **User Preferences**: Manages language, voice settings, timezone

### **2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- **RAG Query**: Searches knowledge base for relevant information
- **Context Awareness**: Uses conversation history for better responses
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic knowledge base integration

### **3. Email Automation**
- **Professional Templates**: Branded email templates
- **Timezone Handling**: User-specific scheduling
- **Delivery Tracking**: Monitor email success rates

### **4. Callback System**
- **Multi-channel**: Email, SMS, phone call scheduling
- **Priority Management**: Urgent vs. normal follow-ups
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor callback completion

### **5. CRM Integration**
- **GoHighLevel Integration**: Automatic contact creation
- **Pipeline Management**: Lead tracking and automation
- **Custom Fields**: Store call data and preferences
